# jukebox
Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software that supports plugins written in Go.

Jukebox is an extension of [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). In a nutshell, Jukebox exposes all of the capabilities of Dragonfly to the Disc (Plugin) API, and is not actually server software itself. If one wants to contribute to the underlying Minecraft server software (e.g. add functionality missing from the vanilla software) then one will need to contribute to Dragonfly.
